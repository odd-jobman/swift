/// Incrementally compute and represent basic block liveness of a single live
/// range. The live range is defined by points in the CFG, independent of any
/// particular SSA value; however, it must be contiguous. Unlike traditional
/// variable liveness, a definition within the live range does not create a
/// "hole" in the live range. The client initializes liveness with a set of
/// definition blocks, typically a single block. The client then incrementally
/// updates liveness by providing a set of "interesting" uses one at a time.
///
/// This supports discovery of pruned liveness during control flow traversal. It
/// is not tied to a single SSA value and allows the client to select
/// interesting uses while ignoring other uses.
///
/// The PrunedLiveBlocks result maps each block to its current liveness state:
/// Dead, LiveWithin, LiveOut.
///
/// A LiveWithin block has a liveness boundary within the block. The client can
/// determine the boundary's instruction position by searching for the last use.
///
/// LiveOut indicates that liveness extends into a successor edges, therefore,
/// no uses within that block can be on the liveness boundary, unless that use
/// occurs before a def in the same block.
///
/// All blocks are initially assumed Dead. Initializing a definition block marks
/// that block LiveWithin. Each time an interesting use is discovered, blocks
/// liveness may undergo one of these transitions:
///
/// - Dead -> LiveWithin
/// - Dead -> LiveOut
/// - LiveWithin -> LiveOut
///
/// Example 1. Local liveness.
///
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveWithin]
/// | Use |
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///
/// Example 2. Cross-block liveness.
///
/// Initial State after initializing a def block:
///
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveWithin]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [Dead]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Use | [Dead]
///  -----
///
/// Later state after updateForUse is applied to the use:
///
///  -----
/// | Def | [LiveOut]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// |     | [LiveOut]
///  -----
///    |
///  -----
/// | Use | [LiveWithin]
///  -----
///
///
/// An invariant is that for any liveness region, the post-dominating blocks of
/// the region are the LiveWithin regions.

/// Discover "pruned" liveness for an arbitrary set of uses. The client builds

/// to updateForUse().
///
/// For SSA live ranges, a single "def" block will dominate all uses. If no def
/// block is provided, liveness is computed as if defined by a function
/// argument. If the client does not provide a single, dominating def block,
/// then the client must at least ensure that no uses precede the first
/// definition in a def block. Since this analysis does not remember the
/// positions of defs, it assumes that, within a block, uses follow
/// defs. Breaking this assumption will result in a "hole" in the live range in
/// which the def block's predecessors incorrectly remain dead. This situation
/// could be handled by adding an updateForUseBeforeFirstDef() API.

/// We allow for multiple bits of liveness information to be tracked by
/// internally using a SmallBitVector. The multiple bit tracking is useful when
/// tracking state for multiple fields of the same root value. To do this, we

/// LiveOut, LiveWithin. This was previously unnecessary since we could just
/// represent dead by not having liveness state for a block. With multiple bits
